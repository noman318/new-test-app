          <h4>Transportation</h4>
          <p>
            Along with the trek services, we also provide transportation
            services to and fro to the basecamp from the nearest city with a
            railway station or airport. Also, we offer a few gears on rent.
          </p>
          <p>
            While registering for a trek, you need to book with your trek fee
            only. Once the registration is done, your trek is confirmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding your transportation and rental gears, we will be reaching
            you 15 days before your trek date. These services are optional. You
            can either confirm them with us or make the arrangements at your
            end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: All services are subject to payment confirmation only. Also,
            these are subject to availability, so timely confirmation will be
            expected from your side in response to our Rental and transportation
            email.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case of government orders, harsh weather conditions, protests,
            landslides, or any other unforeseen circumstances, we will work out
            the best possible alternate plans or trips/treks. At times even
            certain activities are canceled, and the organization provides the
            best alternate but no refunds are provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            All travelers are requested to stay connected to our WhatsApp group
            before and during the trek for timely information.
